# Plotly-challenge

This is an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in this study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

You can select a dataset ID from the dropdown menu to explore all the varieties of navel fauna & flora that were studied!

Enjoy!
