# Plotly-challenge

This is an interactive dashboard to explore a Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels! The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in this study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

To start, you can select a dataset ID from the dropdown menu to explore all the varieties of navel fauna & flora that were studied. The dropdown is created using D3 methods to: populate the menu's options, accept a user's input...

...and then, to query the dataset json and create the Demographic table and two Plotly charts (the horizontal bar chart and bubble diagram with tooltip popups, shown below).
